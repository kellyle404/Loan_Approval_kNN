# Loan approval prediction using k-Nearest-Neighbour model

## Objectives:
1. **Data wrangling**: Undertake thorough data wrangling processes to ensure data quality and prepare it for further analysis.
2. **Predictive modelling**: Construct and implement a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) model to predict loan approval outcomes based on each applicant's attributes.
3. **Feature engineering** Apply simple linear regression to assess the relevancy of predictor variables in order to enhance the predictive capabilities of the KNN model.

## Scope
The dataset can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LIvIdqdHDFEGnfzIgEh4L6GFirzsE3US/view?usp=sharing). It encompasses information from 598 loan applications, covering variables like Gender, Marital Status, Dependents, Education, Self-Employed status, Applicant Income, Coapplicant Income, Loan Amount, Loan Amount Term, Credit History, and Property Area.

## Inquiry questions
* How do different factors such as credit history, marital status, and income contribute to loan approval?
* What is the accuracy of the custom-built KNN model in predicting loan approval status?
* How could the model be improved through feature engineering?
