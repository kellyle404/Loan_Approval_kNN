    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has 3 primary objectives:\n",
    "1. **Data wrangling**: Undertake thorough data wrangling processes to ensure data quality and prepare it for further analysis.\n",
    "2. **Predictive modelling**: Construct and implement a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) model to predict loan approval outcomes based on each applicant's attributes.\n",
    "3. **Feature engineering** Apply simple linear regression to assess the relevancy of predictor variables in order to enhance the predictive capabilities of the KNN model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope\n",
    "The dataset can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LIvIdqdHDFEGnfzIgEh4L6GFirzsE3US/view?usp=sharing). It encompasses information from 598 loan applications, covering variables like Gender, Marital Status, Dependents, Education, Self-Employed status, Applicant Income, Coapplicant Income, Loan Amount, Loan Amount Term, Credit History, and Property Area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inquiry questions\n",
    "\n",
    "* How do different factors such as credit history, marital status, and income contribute to loan approval?\n",
    "* What is the accuracy of the custom-built KNN model in predicting loan approval status?\n",
    "* How could the model be improved through feature engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project outline\n",
    "\n",
    "The project begins with importing necessary libraries and loading the loan dataset for analysis (Section 2). Subsequently, Section 3 analyses the dataset, covering descriptive statistics, handling missing values, and ensuring data integrity. Section 4 is dedicated to constructing the K-nearest-neighbour model. Section 5 evaluates the accuracy of the constructed model while Section 6 further explores a simple feature engineering approach using simple linear regression to refine the model."

    "Unfortunately, utilising all features comes with some downsides. A notable drawback is computational – computing Euclidean distances takes a considerable amount of time with a high number of features. Additionally, the inclusion of irrelevant variables may introduce bias. Therefore, the preference is for discriminative features – those that contribute to accurately classifying the test set as much as possible. This process, aimed at improving the performance of a classifier, is commonly referred to as feature selection or, more broadly, feature engineering.\n",
